## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Authentication Security:** SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities could compromise user data
2. **Data Integrity:** Invalid data being saved could corrupt database
3. **Session Management:** Improper session handling could lead to unauthorized access

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Application may not work consistently across browsers
2. **Performance:** Slow page loads could impact user experience
3. **Validation Bypass:** Client-side validation could be bypassed

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive security testing for all input fields
- Server-side validation verification
- Regular performance monitoring
- Cross-browser testing in CI/CD pipeline

5. Session expires after period of inactivity
6. Data changes must be persisted immediately after save
7. All user inputs must be sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities
8. UI must be responsive across different screen sizes
9. Page load times should not exceed 5 seconds
10. System must handle concurrent user sessions

## Out of Scope

- Advanced admin functionalities
- Report generation features
- Employee management by managers
